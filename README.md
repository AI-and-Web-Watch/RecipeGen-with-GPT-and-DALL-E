## Overview of the Project Structure

This repository consists of two main parts:

1. **Backend**: A Flask server that handles the interactions with the OpenAI's APIs.
2. **Frontend**: A React.js application that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the application.

## Getting Started

The instructions for setting up the Backend and Frontend are located in their respective directories. Here's how you can get started:

### Backend

The backend is responsible for processing requests and interacting with the OpenAI APIs. To get the backend up and running, please follow the instructions in the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend
